            Use to preserve things from IL2CPP stripping.
            Usage:
            - Assembly: preserves all types in the assembly (as if a preserve attribute were on each type)
            - Type: preserves the type and its default constructor
            - Method: preserves the methods declaring type, return type, and a the types of all of its arguments
            - Property, Field, Event: preserves the declaring type and return type

            <summary>
            Axis 2D is a combination of values from two individual Axes. This is primarily used for analog sticks.
            A radial deadzone is applied to the combined values. The deazone is the larger of the two deadzones set in the individual axes.
            Axis 2D cannot be mapped with an ActionElementMap. Instead, the component axes are each mapped individually.
            When two Axes are combined into an Axis2D, the values of the individual Axes are changed to reflect the radial deadzone applied by the parent Axis2D.

            Force this hat to behave as a 4-way hat. This only has any effect if the hat is an 8-way hat.
            If enabled, the corner directions will activate the adjacent 2 cardinal direction buttons instead of the corner button.
            This is useful if you need the hat to behave like a D-Pad instead of an 8-way hat.
            If the global ReInput.configuration.force4WayHats is enabled, setting this to false will have no effect as the global flag overrides this value.

        <member name="P:Rewired.Joystick.unityId">
            <summary>
            The unity joystick id of this joystick. This value is only used on platforms that use Unity input as the underlying input source.
            This value is a 1-based index corresponding to the joystick number in the Unity input manager.
            Generally, you should never need to use this, but it is exposed for advanced uses.
            Returns 0 if the platform does not use Unity input or if the joystick is not associated with a Unity joystick.

        <member name="P:Rewired.Joystick.deviceInstanceGuid">
            <summary>
            The unique persistent instance GUID of this device.
            This is an id generated for the device that may stay constant between application sessions and system restarts.
            This can be used for device assignment persistence between runs. The specific platform and input sources in use
            affects the reliability of this value for device assignment persistence.
            A value of Guid.Empty means the device or input source has no reliable unique identifier so persistant assignment
            isn't possible using this value. Even if a Guid is provided, reliability when multiple identical controllers are
            attached depends greatly on the platform and input source(s) currently in use.

            Mouse Axis - Value range that depends on speed of movement. The value can and does exceed +/- 1.0 by a large amount. This value is the same value returned by Unity's Input.GetAxis when axis type is set to Mouse Movement. Mouse Sensitivity is multiplied by the axis value.
            Digital Axis - Any mouse movement returns a value from -1.0 to 1.0 and is smoothed by the digital axis filters. This makes mouse movement behave like a button or key press.
            ScreenPositionDelta - A value from -1.0 to 1.0 that represents the distance moved across the screen over the update cycle. The value is normalized based on the width and height of the screen. A movement across the entire screen distance in one update cycle will return +/- 1.0.
            Speed - A value based on the speed the mouse is moved across the screen. Speed is calculated from the mouse movement delta / delta time. The returned value can exceed +/- 1.0.

            Digital Axis - Any movement returns -1 to 1 and is smoothed by digital axes values. Mouse movement behaves like a button or keyboard key press. Mouse sensitivity does not affect this mode. Instead, all Digital Axis filters are applied.

            Is this Player currently playing? This property is for user use. It is never set to anything but whatever you set in the Rewired Input Manager Player's page for the "Is Playing on Start" field. The only thing that Player.isPlaying affects internally is Joystick Auto-Assignment if "Assign to Playing Players Only" is set to True. One might use Player.isPlaying to flag that a Player has joined in and is active or has quit/lost all their lives, etc. Player.isPlaying does not affect input returned by the Player.

            It's just small wrapper around an array so it's fast.
            Wouldn't be fast for large collections because it doesn't use buckets and hash
            like a dict and has to linearly search the array, but this will never be large.
            Tests show it about 40% faster than a Dictionary of the same length with the same

            Set this to a higher value if you need higher precision input timing at high frame rates such as for a music beat game. Higher values result in higher CPU usage. Note that setting this to a very high value when the game is running at a low frame rate will not result in higher precision input.
            This settings only applies to input sources that use a separate thread to poll for joystick input values (currently XInput and Direct Input). This setting does not apply to event-based input sources such as Raw Input.

            <summary>
            Defer controller connected events for controllers already connected when Rewired initializes until the Start event instead of
            during initialization. Normally, it's impossible to receive controller connection events at the start of runtime because Rewired
            initializes before any other script is able to subscribe to the controller connected event. Enabling this will defer the controller
            connected events until the Start event, allowing your scripts to subscribe to the controller connected event in Awake and still
            receive the event callback. If disabled, controller connection events for controllers already connected before runtime starts will be missed.

            <summary>
            Gets the first template Element Identifier on the first joystick template found that maps to the joystick's Element Identifier.
            NOTE: It is discouraged to use this method as the mapping template system wasn't designed for this use. This method has been added
            as a short-term solution to the problem of trying to identify controller elements as generic Gamepad elements for use in displaying
            visual help to users. A better solution will be available in the future and this method will be deprecated at that time.
